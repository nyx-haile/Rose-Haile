My dev stack is primarily python, javavscript, and C++, but I'm always excited to learn new languages. Recently I learned swift for work I did at Vana, and I'm currently learning Rust. I also enjoy bash scripting.

In the next few months I'll be: 
 
[Writing some scripts to interface with the mindbody API to streamline check-in](https://github,com/nyx-haile/mindbody)
[Working on my personal website](https://github,com/nyx-haile/projects)
[Learning Rust](https://github,com/nyx-haile/language-learning)
[Writing a trading algorithm](https://github,com/nyx-haile/tr8r2)
[Building a remoteless electric skateboard](https://github,com/nyx-haile/sk9)
